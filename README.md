# Quote Game

In this personal project, I am going to create a fun little game. 

Basically, the game will pop up quotes and 4 authors. The players' goal is to pick the right author.

Here are some features about it:
- get points if the answer is correct, highest score will be saved
- different sections (for example, quotes from different movie franchises)
- beautiful UI

The game is made for movie fans, trivia enthusiasists, or just anyone who gets bored. Everyone can enjoy it

I am interested in this project because I like to play little games when I don't know what to do. I think if I can use this opportunity to test my knowledge, it will be great
